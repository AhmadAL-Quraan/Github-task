You are a developer working on a small project using Git and GitHub to manage source control and collaboration.
Your task is to complete the following steps in order, following proper Git workflow practices.
Phase 1: Project Setup
**Create a new GitHub repository using any name you choose.**
**Copy the repository to your local machine.**
**Navigate into the project directory on your computer.**
**Create a text file named notes.txt** and write at least one line of text in it.
**Check the repository status and verify that the new file is detected.**
**Save the initial changes to the repository and upload them to GitHub.**
Phase 2: Viewing Project History
**Display the full history of saved changes in the repository.**
**Display a shortened version of the history showing one entry per change.**
Phase 3: Working with Branches
**Create a new branch for feature development.**
**Switch to the newly created branch.**
**Edit the notes.txt file by adding a new line that indicates work on the feature branch.**
**Compare the current version of the file with the last saved version.**
**Save the changes in the feature branch.
Upload the feature branch to GitHub.**
Phase 4: Discarding Changes
**Modify the notes.txt file again without saving the change to the repository.**
**View the difference between the modified file and the saved version.**
**Discard the latest change and restore the file to its last saved state.**
**Confirm that the repository has no pending changes.**
Phase 5: Pull Request
**On GitHub, create a Pull Request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.**
Phase 6: Creating a Conflict
**Return to the main branch locally.**
**Modify the same line in notes.txt that was previously changed in the feature branch.**
**Save the change and upload it to GitHub.**
**Attempt to complete the Pull Request and observe the merge conflict.**
**Resolve the conflict so that the final file content is clear and correct.
Save the conflict resolution.
Complete the merge successfully.**
Phase 7: Searching the Repository
**Use Git to search the project files for a word that exists in notes.txt.**
**Perform another search using a different word.**
Phase 8: Inspecting Changes
**Display detailed information about the most recent saved change, including file modifications.**
**Display detailed information for an older saved change using its identifier.**
Phase 9: Undoing Commits
**View the project history again.**
**Undo the most recent saved change while keeping the file changes locally.**
**Undo another saved change and remove the file changes completely.**
Check the repository status after undoing the changes.
Final Verification & Submission
Ensure the main branch contains the final version of notes.txt.
Ensure the project history reflects all completed phases.
